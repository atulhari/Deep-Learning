# Deep-Learning
This repo involves works on various concepts of deep learning like:
Naive Bayesian classification with Gaussian likelihoods leading to linear and quadratic classifiers;
Performance measures: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, accuracy, error rate, area under curve;
Training principles: usage of training set, tuning set and test set and cross validation;
A variety of distribution-free classifiers: k-NNR, support vector machines, artificial feed forward neural network with back propagation, decision tree, random forest;
Deep learning: convolutional neural networks;
Clinical motivation and medical applications.
